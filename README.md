# Odin_form
This project will use HTML,CSS, JS
In this Project, I plan to implement a form with functional checks and styles to typical problematic styles seen in forms. 

Here is the organization and pre-code set up
1. Gather all text and images wanted, lets just get our words done and style after.

2. Looks like the page is split up from the left and right, with the right taking more space than the left. So this can be an image with a image container and a form side container, since the logo appears to be to stay at the left, I think these are the first separations I need, so 2 divs after the main.

3. The logo side has no other sections, so i think that's it for that

4. The form side has 2 sections, a top heading and the form area

5. The form has 2 sections, the form entry and a submit button
